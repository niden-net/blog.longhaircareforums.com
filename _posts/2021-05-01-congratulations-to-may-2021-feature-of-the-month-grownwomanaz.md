## What is your hair care regimen?

I like to keep my regimen simple with weekly to every 10 days protein and DC treatments. I'm a long time henna head so every 6 to 8 weeks I either apply a cassia mask or henna/indigo. I use shampoo once or twice a month. I alternate shampoo and diluted acv on wash day.

## Currently how long is your hair?

My hair is currently between full BSL and MBL. I believe I am 3c/4a with borderline low to medium density. My individual strands are coarse which gives me the illusion of having more hair than I actually have. My porosity is naturally high

## Do you take any supplements, if so what are they?

I take a liquid multi-vitamin daily along with marine collagen and a probiotic. I also incorporate chlorella and spirulina smoothies into my diet but not on a daily basis. My daily water intake is between 80-100 ounces.

## What are the things that you feel have helped you the most in achieving and maintaining your hair length?

Definitely limited direct heat and finger de-tangling have helped me. I rarely flat iron my hair. I have been using my RevAir lately to blow out my hair. It actually suck dries the hair with low heat for those who aren't familiar lol. I am scissor happy but I have cut way back on the frequency of my trims. I cut my hair to full SL the end of 2017. The pictures are from 2016 or 2015 I wasn't able to upload new photos.
