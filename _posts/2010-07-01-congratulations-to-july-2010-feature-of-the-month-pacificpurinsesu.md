## What is your hair care regimen?

I relax with vitale mo body every 16 weeks at the salon. At the same time I get my ends trimmed not because my ends are damaged, but to keep a nice hemline and prevent splits . I wash my hair every 4 days . I use a moisturizing shampoo like Kera Care or kenra and only apply shampoo to my scalp this prevents dryness and tangling. I then squeeze out the water instead of towel blotting. I apply any conditioner that is super moisturizing like kera care Humecto or kenra MC . I sit under for the dryer for 30 minutes . I then allow my hair to cool off and rinse in the shower with cold water. After I thoroughly rinse out all the conditioner, I apply a small quarter size amount of any moisturizing cheap conditioner and let it sit for 2 minutes at this point I start to detangle ( I use the flow of the shower water to assist in the detangling process, works great!)

I rinse again with very cold water and squeeze all the water out. I spray a little pantene detangler and comb through. At this point I have no tangles, I then apply a little salerm b5 and seal with jojoba hobacare and Japanese camelia oil.

I then rollerset my hair on mesh rollers in nice small sections, so that my hair dries faster. The thicker the sections the longer my hair takes to dry. I go under the dryer for about 45 minutes and air dry for another hour, so this way I use less heat.I then remove the rollers , place satin covered foam rollers that I have in jumbo (goody brand) on and place a silk scarf over my head . In the morning I remove the rollers ,lightly comb and clip my hair with a bear claw clip. I use aphogee 2 min a week before and a week after my relaxer touch up.

## Do you take any supplements? If so, what are they?

No, I do not. I eat a lot of fresh fruit and vegetables with each meal . I also drink a lot of green tea, milk and water daily.

## Currently, how long is your hair and what is your hair type?

My hair is currently hip length. I would say a 4a.

## What are the things that you feel have helped you the most in achieving and maintaining your hair length?

The forum because all the information needed to grow healthy hair without any gimmicks is here! I know without the information I would never have retained as much length. Also, the wonderful support from all the members who are always willing to help and answer any questions and my favorite the " search " feature! lol..
