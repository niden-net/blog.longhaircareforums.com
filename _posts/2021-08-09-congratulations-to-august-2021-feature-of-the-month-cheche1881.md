## What is your hair care regimen? 

My regimen is very simple. I wash, condition, deep condition once a month. And moisturize when my hair feels dry in between. Sometimes I wash sooner, but typically I stick to my monthly schedule. 

## Currently how long is your hair?

 My hair is sitting slightly longer than waist length.

## Do you take any supplements, if so which ones?

I do not take any traditional supplements; however, I do consume diatomaceous earth on a regularly basis.

## What are the things that you feel  have helped you the most in achieving and maintaining your hair length? 

The key for me has been to just let y hair do its thing. I try not to over style, over manipulate my hair. I keep it simple!
