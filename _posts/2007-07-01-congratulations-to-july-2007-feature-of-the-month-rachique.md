## What is your hair care regimen?

My hair regimen is simple, I have to keep it simple since I don't have time and being a product junkie I have to use whatever I have, it also changes as I respond to the needs of my hair. I wash my hair at least 4 times a week with one or two of those being a full shampoo and condition. The other two (or more) are basic conditioner washes. I use different conditioners but always tend to go back to Pantene products as they seem to suit my hair the best. I avoid protein shampoos and conditioners since my hair doesn't need them. Firstly I divide my hair into two parts to make it easier; I will wash with any shampoo (except a clarifying one) and rinse thoroughly and then apply conditioner generously and put my hair up. After five minutes I detangle and leave again for another couple of minutes. I rinse under running water for several minutes to ensure there are no tangles. In the shower I use a Vidal Sassoon Hair Hydration shower comb. Then I gently towel dry my hair by placing the hair in between a towel and applying pressure with the palms of my hands I will then apply regular conditioner such as Pantene Extra Straight/Herbal Essences Hello Hydration/Nexxus Humectress, comb it through and put up in a towel to absorb any extra moisture. I then comb it again with a Denman large comb (my hair is probably about 80% dry at this point) and apply some Pantene extra liso combing crÃ¨me, put my hair up in a bun and leave it to dry. I don't deep condition often since I don't feel my hair needs it, but I will occasionally apply conditioner to dry hair and leave for 30 minutes before I wash as above (minus the shampoo). I do trim my hair regularly to avoid split ends (I hardly get them so it must be working!), my ends can become dry looking though if I don't take care when bunning, so I apply a tiny amount of coconut oil to them whilst wet if necessary. I also avoid styling products and only use them if I am not going to be wearing my Hijab (which is not often), I have recently used Control Freak by TiGi Bead Head and do like it as it helps me achieve a straight sleek look. I relax with Phyto Index II once a year, this ensures I have enough new growth to avoid major overlapping (especially during the rinsing part) and also gives me more than sufficient time to prepare my hair and allow it to rest and recover in between. I have my hair relaxed to about 80% straightness which leaves it plenty of volume and body.

## Do you take any supplements? If so, what are they?

I don't take supplements for two reasons a) I forget to take them and b) I don't feel they are necessary if you maintain a good healthy balanced diet. I ensure I eat five portions of fruit & veg daily, drink plenty of water and eat oily fish at least 4 times a week. Incorporating fish into my diet has given me the fastest growth and the healthiest hair I have ever had (I was a vegetarian prior to this).

## Currently, how long is your hair and what is your hair type?

I believe my hair is just past BSL length (due a major cut) and is type 3b though I have some small parts of 4a at the front. My hair is different lengths as I cut it myself and cut layers into it.

## What are the things that you feel have helped you the most in achieving and maintaining your hair length?

I feel that low manipulation and leaving my hair alone to its own devices has been the best. I do not comb my hair except when it has just been washed; I leave it up in a bun till the next wash day. Not trying new things just because I can, I have learnt to respond to my hairs needs and not just throw things at it. I feel that trying too many things has affected my hair; my hair wants to grow and will grow when I leave it to do so.

I rarely use heat on my hair and probably do so no more than roughly four times a year, this is not because I feel heat it bad but too much heat is bad. I have always eaten healthily but did not have any protein in my diet and so started eating fish in particular salmon this, I believe, has helped my hair to be healthy, moisturised and strong. Also washing my hair regularly, I personally don't feel I could have healthy hair without washing it after all I couldn't expect healthy skin without washing it and taking care of it. Also just appreciating my hair and enjoying it and adopting a super simple approach to hair care; not being too obsessed about anything to with hair.
