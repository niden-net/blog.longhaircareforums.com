## What is your hair care regimen?

I wash my hair 1-2x per week, con washing as necessary, and wear mainly a puff or wash and go styles.

I prefer natural shampoos and conditioners such as Jason, Giovanni and Druide. I'm currently using Burt's Bees moisturizing shampoo and conditioner after having success with their avocado butter pre-shampoo treatment, which I use once per week. I also like to experiment from time to time with various tips from the board such as using milk, honey, etc.

I seal moisture in my hair with natural oils such as jojoba, grapeseed, and Ecco Bella Intensive Therapy. I don't typically use moisturizers when I'm wearing my hair natural. Sometimes at night I will do a scalp massage with my oil mixture (EB, jojoba, and Aura Cacia essential oil).

I straighten my hair about 2 times per year, and generally trim during this time. Otherwise I dust as needed.

## Do you take any supplements? If so, what are they?

I take Natrol My Favorite Multiple -Take One formula

## Currently, how long is your hair and what is your hair type?

4a natural, super coily and springy. When straightened my hair is midback, when airdried naturally it shrinks to about neck length.

## What are the things that you feel have helped you the most in achieving and maintaining your hair length?

Going natural has helped me maintain stronger hair, which helps with retaining length.

Washing more frequently has helped me achieve more growth and keeps my hair moisturized.

For me the most important thing is to be consistent within reason. I know that my hair needs to be washed fairly frequently to flourish, so I always keep that in mind. I also know that my hair does not do well with too many products, so I keep post-wash products to a minimum. Beyond that, I don't mind experimenting with different products or techniques that I believe will be beneficial or just fun to try. But I never let it get too complicated or overwhelming.
