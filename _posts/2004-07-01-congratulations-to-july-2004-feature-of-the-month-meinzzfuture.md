## What is your hair care regimen?

I wash once a week to every week and a half with Creme of nature shampoo (the one with the shampoo and conditioner in one), I use Nutrine Garlic Shampoo if I need to curb any excessive shedding, i deep condition with Motions CPR and use Garnier Fructis conditioner after deep conditioning.

I perm with PCJ NO lye- regular strength. For maintenance, I try to wrap my hair every night and tie it up in my satin head tie. Once in the blue, I surge so I'm not sure if that works either. I get about 1/4" a month.

My last trim was about 7 weeks ago or so hen I got rid of about 2 inches to finally even out my hair and get the last of my highlights out. At that time, I also used Sebastians Colorshines in Brilliant Brown.

## Currently how long is your hair?

I'm estimating my hair to be at about 25 inches. Hair type I'm also guessing to be 4A.

## Do you take any supplements, if so what are they?

I'm currently taking Country Life Biotin 5000mcg but I really don't think its contributing to any growth. I think that Solgar Biotin 1000mcg was still a little more potent.

## What are the things that you feel have helped you the most in achieving and maintaining your hair length?

I think my hair length is due to genetics and what has helped me to maintain my length is going to the salon to have it professionally done because whenever I attempt to do my own hair, it's a wreck and there is shedding and breakage all over the place. I also never use heat unless if its the hooded dryer or a curling iron to curl my bangs like once every two months since I hardly wear them out.
