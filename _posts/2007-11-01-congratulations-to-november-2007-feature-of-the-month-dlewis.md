## What is your hair care regimen?

I texlax every 1" of new growth (approx every 8 weeks) with Lady Velvet Mild Relaxer. Trimming whenever I texlax.

During the warmer months, I condition wash almost daily using V05 Conditioners, apply oil and wear protective styles. I normally only shampoo once a week.

During the cooler months, I prepoo with Alma Oil for 30 minutes, wash with V05 Extra Body Shampoo, Condition with Hemp Hydrating Condition and/or VO5 Extra Body Conditioner, rollerset and dry my hair for 2 hours. (My roots are normally super curly but that is ok.) I wrap my hair every night. I apply oil to my hair on a daily basis making sure I concentrate on the ends. I deep condition my hair monthly with Alma Oil under the dryer for 30 minutes. I only blowdry and flat iron a couple of times of year to see the true length.

My Staples are:
* Amla Oil (regular and lite)
* Coconut Oil
* Hemp Hydrating Conditioner
* VO5 Extra Body Shampoo and all VO5 Conditioners
* Cream of Nature Moisturizing Conditioner

Other products:
* Kemi Oil
* Shikakai Herbal Hair Oil
* Amla powder
* Hemp Hydrating Shampoo

## Do you take any supplements? If so, what are they?

I don't take any supplements. I try to eat somewhat healthy by including lots of fruits, vegetables, beans, fish and water into my diet.

## Currently, how long is your hair and what is your hair type?

My hair is layered and is mostly below BSL with the shortest being a APL. (I'm hoping for MBL really soon) I think my hair type is mostly 3c with 4a at the crown. My hair is medium thick and wavy. Color is reddish, brown, and gray.

## What are the things that you feel have helped you the most in achieving and maintaining your hair length?

* Keeping my hair moisturized
* Protective styling which includes buns, braids and frenchrolls.
* Stretching relaxers to every 1" of new growth, any longer causes breakage for me.
* Detangle my hair when it's soaking wet or saturated with conditioner.
* Weekly deep conditioning
* Clipping ends when needed (mostly every other month)
* Quality hair accessories that don't cause breakage or too much tension on the hair (Flexi8 and Ficcare are my favorites)
* Sticking with the two regimens mentioned above
* Minimum heat (I use indirect heat when I rollerset but I flat iron a couple of times a year)
* AND the love and support from my family and my beloved LHCF family.
