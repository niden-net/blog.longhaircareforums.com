## What is your hair care regimen?

My hair is natural and I press it occasionally for straight styles. My regimen consists of deep conditioning, moisturizing, low manipulation, protective styling and low heat usage.

I apply a mixture of aloe vera liquid (or liquid gel) mixed with black castor oil, olive oil and essential oils to my dry hair and place a plastic bag on my head for about 15 minutes to 2 hours (**deep conditioning**). I section the hair and finger comb it and put it into loose braids. Then I wash my hair in those braids to minimize tangles (low manipulation). I place about two capfuls of shampoo into three cups of hot water and dilute that and spread the soapy water evenly over my braids and hair. I rinse my hair and use a cholesterol type conditioner mixed with olive oil and put that on my braids (**deep conditioning**). I unloosen each braid and comb it through with the conditioner still on it. Then I re-braid the section of hair and repeat until all my hair is combed out and loosely re-braided. I rinse out the conditioner from my braided hair. I unloosen the braids for a final rinse. I place some more of my aloe vera/castor oil/essential oils mixture on my freshly washed, detangled, loose, wet hair (**sealing in moisture**). I add a bit of curl activator and spray the hair to be braided with my conditioner concoction (cheap conditioner, curl activator, water, Infusium, essential oils, olive oil), slather the last 3-6 inches of hair with vaseline, braid it and put on a baggie (**sealing in moisture and protective styling**).

Every six weeks to three months, I use Aphogee hard protein with heat in my hair.

If I am wearing my hair straightened, I clarify my hair with water mixed with apple cider vinegar and don't add any product to my hair a couple of days before I get it done. I then have my stylist wash and straighten my hair. I bring in a tube of Vitapoint and have her put on a dime size dab in my wet hair to protect against heat prior to her blowing it dry and pressing it.

## Do you take any supplements? If so, what are they?

No supplements.

## Currently, how long is your hair and what is your hair type?

My hair hangs thick and full past my natural waist. I do not use hair typing.

## What are the things that you feel have helped you the most in achieving and maintaining your hair length?

* Taking responsibility for and control of the health of my hair.
* Setting goals for my hair and writing them down.

* Being on LHCF and perusing the various hair albums.
* Finding a process/regimen for my hair and sticking with the regimen.
