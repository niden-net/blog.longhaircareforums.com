## What is your hair care regimen?

My regimen is simple:

* Pre-poo with EVOO, and Shampoo with CON 1 time a week. I sometimes alternate shampooing for ACV rinse.
* DC with ORS mixed with EVOO and EVCO 1 time a week.
* Co wash maybe 1 -2 times a week w/VO5 Moistures Milk.
* Do Aphogee 2 min, every blue moon.

I used NTM as my daily moisturizer and seal with EVCO with not in a protective style. While in protective styles such as crochets or sew ins to moisturize I do a VO5/water mix, NTM/water mix, or glycerin/water mix in a spray bottle. I use castor oil for edges.

## Do you take any supplements? If so, what are they?

I've never tried any growth aids. I only take Be Whole Multivitamins from GNC. I've been taking them sporadically throughout my HHJ up until a month or so ago. I've been trying to take them more regularly.

## Currently, how long is your hair and what is your hair type?

I started at SL in June 09, and I'm now very happy to say a year later I'm BSL! As for hair type, I'm doing a long term transition to natural and my hair type is a 3C/4A. My last relaxer was June 09.

## What are the things that you feel have helped you the most in achieving and maintaining your hair length?

What's helped me the most in achieving and maintaining length are:

- No direct heat- Haven't used directed heat since June of last year.
- Low manipulation - Only comb/brush on wash days
- Deep Conditioning weekly.
- Protective Styles - I mainly wore half wigs, phony ponies and lace fronts the first 6 months of my hhj. For the past 6 months I've been wearing sew ins and crochets. In between installs I've been wearing buns, and bantu knot outs into a curly puffs. Headbands have a lifesaver during my transition.
- No trimming - only dust as needed.
- Moisturizing and sealing.
- Last but not least, constantly gaining knowledge and inspiration from the amazing ladies of LHCF!

Best wishes to all you ladies and HHG!
