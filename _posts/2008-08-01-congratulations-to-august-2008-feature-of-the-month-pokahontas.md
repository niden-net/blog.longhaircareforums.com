## What is your hair care regimen?

I follow a low-manipulation regimen which I truly believe helps me retain the most length. I try not to comb my hair much, finger comb as much as possible and when I do comb it's with a very wide tooth comb.

I try to use direct heat as little as possible if at all. I use it maybe a few times a year and I feel that the less direct heat I use the healthier my hair and the longer it grows. This has been the most important thing to me for hair growth. To wear my hair straight w/o using direct heat I'll ponytail rollerset and do a silk wrap.

Deep condition on dry hair twice a month, with Pantene Relaxed and Natural Breakage Defense Deep Conditioning Mask (my fav.), Elasta QP DPR-11 or Cholesterol. I'll either sit under the dryer for 20 minutes or leave on over night covered with a plastic cap.

Clarify twice a month using baking soda mixed in my shampoo or diluted apple cider vinegar.

Protein treatments once a month using Motions CPR or Duo-Tex. Follow up with deep conditioner under the dryer.

I don't do trims but I like to do frequent dustings to keep things fresh. Hanging on to old ends was a major set back for me in the past so I try to keep up with my dustings. I really don't have a schedule, just whenever I feel like I need it.

Moisturize daily w/ Qhemet Heavy Cream and seal w/ unrefined coconut oil, shikaikai oil, or jojoba oil. I like to use as many natural products as I can.

I wear my hair straight or in braid-outs in the fall/winter and curly in the spring/summer. I shampoo once a week and co-wash again that same week only in summer. In winter I shampoo once a week for braid/twist-outs and every two weeks for straight styles/roller-sets.

At night my hair is always covered. When it's curly I will pin it back and cover.....for braid/twist-outs I'll re-braid at night and for my straight styles I'll cross wrap or band at night.
