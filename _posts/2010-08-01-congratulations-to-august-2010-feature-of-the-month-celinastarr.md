## What is your hair care regimen?

Lately, I have been co/water washing once or twice a week. I use Giovanni conditioners to co wash and as a leave in and moisturizer. During the winter months I also use a ltttle Extra Virgin Olive Oil along with conditioner for extra moisture. I let my hair air dry in a braid, updo, or bun. Very rarely do I shampoo and I try to use a sulfate free shampoo such as Burt's Bees when I do. I apply shampoo my scalp and not the length of my hair. I also mostly finger comb and only use my seamless shower comb a few times a year and very rarely do I use my denman brush. I never ever comb my hair dry---only while wet and loaded with conditioner standing in the shower. I get trims as needed; at least once a year. I straighten my hair no more than once a year. My regimen is very simple. No deep conditioning treatments, gels, dyes, etc.

## Do you take any supplements? If so, what are they?

I've recently started taking Womens One A Day vitamins, but it's not for hair growth but for my overall health.

## Currently, how long is your hair and what is your hair type?

My hair now almost touches my pants pockets. Board members have told me that I am a 3c/b mix, but I consider my hair highly textured, coarse, and curly.

## What are the things that you feel have helped you the most in achieving and maintaining your hair length?

I think low manipulation like finger combing has helped me the most and so has co washing and using conditioner only as a leave in. I also try to keep my hair up as much as possible.
