## What is your hair care regimen?

 I wash once every 7-10 days. I do some kind of protein treatment once every 1-2 months. I detangle almost every wash, and do not go more than 2 washes without detangling, as my hair will mat otherwise. I separate a bit with fingers before using a comb or detangling brush. I also blow dry once every 2-6 weeks, usually with a blow dryer with attachment, as I find that it really helps stretch the hair, which in turn helps get the shed hair out, which in turn cuts down on matting and tangling. My favorite products are Trader Joe's Nourish Spa shampoo and conditioner and Qhemet Biologics cocoa tree detangling ghee, as well as castor oil or coconut oil. I will always add an oil after washing or blow drying. Sometimes I add a creamy leave in (like the detangling ghee) under it.\

As for styles, because I'm so busy with young children nowadays, I usually wear medium sized twists in a bun or ponytail. It's a style that's acceptable to me looks-wise and is about the easiest thing I can get away with. Once upon a time I really loved styling my hair in all kinds of ways (no cornrowing, could never do it well), but these days I just don't have the time or energy. Every now and then I'll wear a twist out, down or in a bun. I'm really fond of hair accessories and have a lot that I use to add interest to an otherwise boring hairstyle.



## Currently how long is your hair?

My hair is a bit over 18" root to tip, which on me is about waist length. My hair type is 4c.

## Do you take any supplements, if so what are they?

I take a multi-vitamin.

## What are the things that you feel have helped you the most in achieving and maintaining your hair length?



Gentle handling of my hair is the biggest thing. I detangle fairly gently; I'm naturally tender-headed. Also, I never do wash and gos. The horror, I shudder even thinking about the tear-inducing matted disaster that happens when I try that. Always keeping my hair stretched and oiled helps a lot.
