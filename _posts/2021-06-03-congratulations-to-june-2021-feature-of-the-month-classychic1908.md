## What is your hair care regimen?

 My regimen is very simple. I have 3 children, so I don't have time for anything time consuming.  I like to use natural products and I enjoy mixing things in the kitchen.  Typically, I cowash every 7-10 days and use a shampoo bar as needed.  Most days, I wear a curly bun secured with a satin scrunchie.  I moisturize with herbal sprays of aloe, fenugreek, hibiscus, etc. about every 2 days.  I enjoy DIY flax seed gel when I have time to prepare it. Otherwise, I use natural water based hair gels that are easy to buy.

 

## Currently how long is your hair?



 ​​​​​Mid back to waist 4A/3C

 

## Do you take any supplements, if so what are they?

 

I take vitamin D, iron, and magnesium regularly.  I drink a variety of herbal and spiced teas most days.  A few times a week, I drink collagen and a super greens drink.  I have a collection of herbal supplements that I take as needed. 

 

## What are the things that you feel have helped you the most in achieving and maintaining your hair length?

 

Keeping my regimen simple, managing health concerns, listening to my hair by using mostly water based products, staying moisturized, gentle treatment, protective styling.
