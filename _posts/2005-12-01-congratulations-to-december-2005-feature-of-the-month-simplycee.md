## What is your hair care regimen?

I wash a minimum of twice a week with shampoo. I also rinse wth distilled water or cw every other day if I am wearing protective styles. I deep condition at least once a week with heat. For my hair to be at its healthiest I have to maintain a balance between protein and moisture. One week I deep condition with protein, the next I use an intensive moisturizing conditioner. I usually air dry in a bun. If I'm wearing my hair down I rollerset and dry under a hood dryer then wrap. I moisturize daily, except the first two weeks after a relaxer when I moisturize twice daily. I relax every 10 - 12 weeks with a lye relaxer and trim only when needed. I give my hair a break every year for one relaxer cycle (10-12 weeks) by wearing braids or cornrows.

## Currently how long is your hair?

Daily I take 1/2 tsp of MSM powder in water, 5 mg of biotin, 500 mg of evening primrose oil, 1000 mg of flax seed oil, 1 super b complex tablet and a multi vitamin. MSM has curbed my shedding issues, epo and flax seed oil has helped with my scalp psoriasis issues..

## Do you take any supplements, if so what are they?

Currently my hair is 24 inches long from hairline to ends. My ultimate goal is mid back, I have 3 more inches to go. From looking at my pre relaxer pics my natural hair is 4a mixed with some 4b areas.

## What are the things that you feel have helped you the most in achieving and maintaining your hair length?

I have found that relaxing every 10 - 12 weeks, supplements and frequent washing has boosted my hair growth. Protective styling, daily moisturizing and minimal heat has helped me retain length. LCHF helped me develop a regimen and find products that work for my hair. Thank you ladies for helping me reach my hair goals!
