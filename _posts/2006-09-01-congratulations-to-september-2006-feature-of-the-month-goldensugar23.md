## What is your hair care regimen?

My regimen is simple and as natural as I can get for relaxed hair.

I wash my hair and deep condition once a week.I do braids out and air dry 2x a month and wet sets w/roots blown 2x.

I incorporate only natural oils like coconut and olive oils alone on dry hair and add oils to mostly all my products.I found out my hair is dry and needs a shot of natural moisture(hair lotions are my enemy-except if i need to slick down the pre-touch up fuzzies into a ponytail).

## Do you take any supplements? If so, what are they?

I take a multi-vitamin,flax seed oil(one tablespoon per day),chlorophyll(one capsule per day).

## Currently, how long is your hair and what is your hair type?

My hair length is lower back,I'm not sure the length in inches.My hair type is 3c/4a

## What are the things that you feel have helped you the most in achieving and maintaining your hair length?

First I would like to acknowledge and give lots of love to longhaircareforum!!!!!

I learned about how to care for my hair type.This was crucial because My hair is soft but I still need a relaxer to straighten my hair.I wasnt sure about this because I have worn relaxers for a long time.So I had to ask my mother what is was(lol,she responded with curly afro).After I knew this I knew My hair wouldnt respond to anything to heavy (hair lotions..ect) or strong for it.Also I Could get away with some lighter products if I incorporated some type of light oil to it.
