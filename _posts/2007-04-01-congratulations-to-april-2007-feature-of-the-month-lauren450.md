## What is your hair care regimen?

I wash once every 10-14 days.

**Products used**: Mane and Tail Super Moisturizing Shampoo and Conditioner

I shampoo my hair in the shower, then put the conditoner on, put a plastic cap over it, and sit under my Ion Bonnet dryer for 20 minutes.

I rollerset after each wash.

**Products used**: Aveda Massage Oil, fine-tooth comb, wide-tooth comb, magnetic Rollers, silver clips, bonnet dryer

I detangle with the wide-tooth comb. I then part my hair into sections. Before rolling each section, I apply Aveda oil to the length of the hair to seal in moisture. Then, I comb the ends with the fine-tooth comb to get them smooth. Then, I roll the hair (up for more curl, down for less curl). I secure the rollers with the clips. Then, I sit under my bonnet dryer for about 2 hours. Once done, I flat iron my roots and any puffy spots (I'm texlaxed). When I flat iron, I use Sally Silk Infusion heat protectant and my ceramic flat iron.

Between rollersets, I apply a dime-sized amount of Mane and Tail Conditioner for moisture, and Aveda oil for shine. When it's humid, I use Aveda Anti-humectant pomade to keep moisture out. When I want more curls between rollersets, I use orange rods. At night before bed, I use 4 rods on my dry hair. I roll a large section at the top of my hair, two in the middle, and one on the bottom. The next morning, I have loose curls.

Relaxer:

**Products used**: Vitale Mo' Body Relaxer, Vitale Neutralizing Conditioner, Vitale Neutralizing Shampoo, Applicator Brush, Plastic Gloves, Plastic Caps, Butterfly clips, Suave conditioner, Mane and Tail Super Moisturizing conditioner.

I relax in two sections (top and bottom). I part my hair and apply Suave conditioner throughout (any kind will do). Then, I put a plastic cap on the bottom section and secure it with a clip. I then relax the top section, processing for about 16 minutes. I lean over the tub and rinse the relaxer out. I apply neutralizing conditioner and leave it on for five minutes. Then, I shampoo once. I rinse that, wring out the hair, and apply and secure a plastic cap to the top section.

I repeat the process for the bottom section. I then shampoo all the hair together several times. I then apply the Mane and Tail conditioner and sit under the dryer for 20 minutes.

I comb and wear my hair out pretty much every day. I dust as needed.

## Do you take any supplements? If so, what are they?

I am currently taking Nature Made Prenatal Vitamins. Before the baby, I was taking Nature Made Multi-Vitamins and Biotin

## Currently, how long is your hair and what is your hair type?

My hair is an inch or so below BSL. My type is 4B

## What are the things that you feel have helped you the most in achieving and maintaining your hair length?

I believe relaxer stretching and rollersetting have helped me the most. Relaxer stretching has curbed the breakage (no more overlapping), and rollersetting gives me a smooth look without putting direct heat on my hair. This is most evident with my ends. I rarely trim.
