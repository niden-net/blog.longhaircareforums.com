## What is your hair care regimen?

Once a week (or when I remember), I give myself a 30 minute pre-shampoo treatment using Olive Oil, Honey and Suave Coconut Conditioner. I wash my hair 1-2x per week using Keracare Hydrating Shampoo. I also do a light protein treatment once a week using Aubrey Organics GPB (no heat-30 mins), I follow that up with Keracare Humecto mixed with Hollywood Beauty Olive Cholesterol - I LOVE the way this smells (no heat-30 mins). As a leave-in, I use Aroscio Intervying and either Salerm 21 or Keracare Leave-in with a quarter size amount of Jojoba Oil. I seal my ends with Keracare Silken Seal right before rollersetting.

I wear a bun 99.9% of the time so my ends are always protected. I clarify once a month using Keracare First Lather Shampoo. Every 5-6 weeks, my hair is in need of some serious protein so out comes the Aphogee Treatment followed by their Balancing Moisturizer. The other products I use from time to time are: Joico Triage Shampoo, Joico K-pak, St. Ives Reconstructor Creme of Nature Shampoo, and L'oreal Unfrizz Smoothing Treatment.

## Currently how long is your hair?

My hair is currently 22.5" long and I believe my hair type is 2b/c. My Mom begs to differ but the whole hair type thing is very confusing to me. I can classify my natural hair as being soft, wavy and consisting of a loose "S" type pattern. (If you can decipher from my description what my hair type is, please do tell ... LOL)

## Do you take any supplements, if so what are they?

For about 3 weeks last year, I did take biotin but it broke my face out something fierce. I do not take any supplements for hair growth but I do take GNC Ultramega Woman (or Centrum One a Day) and Cod Liver Oil pills, which promotes healthy hair, skin and nails.

## What are the things that you feel have helped you the most in achieving and maintaining your hair length?

Leaving my hair alone! Wearing it in a protective bun everyday has definitely helped. Keeping my ends moisturized with my own oil concoction which consists of Aloe Vera, Jojoba, Castor, Carrot, Coconut, Lavender, Wheatgerm & Rosemary oils. Not allowing my hair to rub against anything other than silk or satin.

Also, I take care of my hair myself and only go to the salon for a touch-up. My hair is in better health now then it's ever been and I owe it all to the knowledge I've attained from the Forum.

I've also learned that dirty hair for me equals shedding/breakage so I absolutely have to make sure I clean my hair once a week to combat that. Also, combing my hair from ends to roots aids in the detangling process, as does my beloved Keracare products. :)
