## What is your hair care regimen?

I shampoo at least 3 times a week. (Normally after my aerobics class.) When I shampoo, I always rinse with distilled bottled water for final rinse. I do not towel dry (ever) and I finger comb. If I wash and go I always leave in my conditioner (usually Pantene Pro-V or Paul Mitchell Supercharger mixed with about ½ teaspoon of my home made shea/oil butter pomade) followed by a generous amount of Carol's Daughter Healthy Hair Butter. I put my hair into 4 - 6 fat coils and air dry overnight. In the morning, I use some of my own hair pomade, then separate the coils and fluff. I usually wear the sides pulled back with decorative hair pins. This is my main stay in the summer.

When I wetset, I use Lottabody Cream for Wrapping and Setting. I start with soaking wet hair, then apply the setting cream as I roll each section back to the crown. Products: Elucence Shampoo and Conditioner, Aveda Elixer Leave in, ISO Bouncy Crème, Carol's Daughter Healthy Hair Butter and Mimosa Hair Honey, Paul Mitchell Supercharged, Pantene Pro-V Smooth and Sleek Conditioner, Lottabody Crème for Wrapping and Setting (Love this stuff!)

## Currently how long is your hair?

I decided to stop relaxing in June, 2001. In February 2002, I chopped off the relaxed ends of my hair to chin length. My hair is currently just below shoulder length in the back and collar bone length (when completely straight) on the sides. I went through MANY products and routines until I found my current ones. I have one for when I wear my hair natural, and one for when I do a wet roller set. My hair (type) texture is 3C-4A. (According to Andre's system.)

## Do you take any supplements, if so what are they?

* Evening Primrose Oil
* Flaxseed oil
* Centrum Liquid

I take these for overall health and not just hair.

## What are the things that you feel have helped you the most in achieving and maintaining your hair length?

* Cutting out the heat (except when I sit under a hair dryer.)
* No blow drying or curling irons in 2 years (Yea!)
* And I keep my hair moisturized with the best moisturizer there is... Water.
