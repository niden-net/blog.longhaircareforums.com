## What is your hair care regimen?

Right now during the winter, I wash or co-wash my hair while in braids or twists 2-3 times a week. I co-wash almost daily during the warmer months and wear a lot of wash and gos by using a micro fiber hair towel to soak up a lot of the water.

Once a week I take out the braids or twists, I apply castor oil and let it soak in. Then I put my hair in 4 loose braids, wash and, apply pantene relaxed and natural hair mask. I rinse each braid individually and rebraid to avoid a head full of tangles. I apply castor oil or avocado butter to my hair, detangle with my bone comb and then rebraid or twist.

Once a month I do a deep condition with aphogee or ion. I follow it up with fermodyl 619 and then proceed with detangling and styling.

I apply castor oil or avocado butter to my ends every night and sleep with my satin bonnet or scarf I put sulfur 8 on my scalp after every wash only during the winter because the weather is dry here. Occasionally, I will spray my ends at night and then put on the butter and/or oil.

Every 6 months, I go to my beautician. She flat irons, then presses, trims and curls my hair. That is the only time I trim my hair and I usually lose about 1/2 to 1 full inch each time. I wear my hair straight for a week or so just for dh and then the first wash after, I do a deep condition with protein and moisture.

## Do you take any supplements? If so, what are they?

I take Vitality vitamins and minerals by Melaleuca for health reasons. I just try to eat a lot of fruits and veggies, workout, and drink lots of water.

## Currently, how long is your hair and what is your hair type?

My hair is brastrap length about 8-8 1/2 inches on the growth in inches shirt. I am a natural 4b.

## What are the things that you feel have helped you the most in achieving and maintaining your hair length?

1. Finding LHCF and the products that work for me. I use everything from suave, to pantene, to nioxin depending on the condition of my hair and scalp.
2. Paying attention to my hair so I know what to use and when.
3. Finding a regimen that worked and sticking too it.
4. Babying my hair. I take my time combing, styling, and even my beautician takes extra time and care with my hair because she knows just how I like it handled. I tell people all the time, "I am serious about my hair!"
5. Moisturizing my ends, protecting them and enjoying my hair. Because I have the knowledge, I am not afraid to try different styles so I won't get bored with it.
