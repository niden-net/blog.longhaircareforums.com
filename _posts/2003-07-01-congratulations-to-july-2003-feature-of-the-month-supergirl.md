## What is your hair care regimen?

Currently, I have my hair relaxed with Affirm Lye every 12 weeks. I am thinking about changing it to 10 weeks because my new growth comes out very coily and strands begin to coil around each other after so long.

Anyway, I am a major PJ, but I think I have finally simplified my regimen. Five days after a re-touch, I shampoo with a clarifying shampoo(Pantene) and condition with Joico K-Pak and follow with the Joico Moisturizing Conditioner.

For my regular weekly shampoo I use Crème of Nature followed by L'Oreal Nature's Therapy Mega Moisture Nurturing Crème. I sit under the dryer with it 10-15 minutes. I love this conditioner and also like to follow it with the Nature's Therapy Hot Oil for about 5 minutes. In my opinion, these Nature's Therapy products are just wonderful. I have actually been using the hot oil off and on for 5 years.

Every 3rd week, I switch my conditioner to Mizani Moisturefuse or Nexxus OmniPak (mixture of Keraphix, Humectress, Epitome, & Botanic Oils) I follow the OmniPak with Moisturizing Conditioner. Because I am a PJ, I do conditioner washes between my regular weekly shampoos.

I rinse my hair and then I use Motions Oil Moisturizing Conditioner. I do sit under the dryer with it 5-10 minutes. I have not mentioned a leave-in yet because it's such a toss up every week with me. My favorites are Arosci, Motions, Aveda Damage Control, and the new one by Profectiv. I air dry my hair usually, but roller set every once in a while. I do not use heat on my hair with the exception of every few months to give myself a trim.

I do not use a blow dryer for styling, just my ceramic iron. For in between shampoo maintenance and moisture, I use profectiv Break-Free and oils. My favorite oils are avocado and jojoba, but I do use several others as my mood determines! I wear protective styles 99% of the time.

## Currently how long is your hair?

My hair type is 4a/b and it is 26 inches.

## Do you take any supplements, if so what are they?

I feel that not using heat and staying away from scissors happy stylists are the things that have helped me to achieve and maintain my hair length.

## What are the things that you feel have helped you the most in achieving and maintaining your hair length?

I take Andrew Lessman Hair, Skin and Nails available from Home Shopping Network.
