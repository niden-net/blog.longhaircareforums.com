## What is your hair care regimen?

* Wash with a moisturizing shampoo once a week.
* I avoid any shampoo that has sodium laureth sulfate. My staple shampoo is by Elucence
* I co-wash 2 or 3 times a week. (summer only)
* I clarify as needed. (Maybe once a month)

* I deep condition weekly with a heating cap.
* I almost always add EVOO to my deep condition.

* I use protein treatments as needed. (About 1x a month)
* I always use a leave-in conditioner.
* I air dry 95% of the time.

* I moisturize every other day.
* I love oil. I sometimes seal my moisturizer with oil. (Just depends on which moisturizer I am using at the time.)
* I oil my scalp after every wash with an oil by Hair2Heaven.com
* I massage my scalp a few times a week.

## Do you take any supplements? If so, what are they?

I take a multi vitamin, biotin, and flaxseed oil. I try to drink a lot of water. I plan to up my supplements again.

## Currently, how long is your hair and what is your hair type?

My hair is just a few inches below bra-strap. I have 3B/3C hair.

## What are the things that you feel have helped you the most in achieving and maintaining your hair length?

* Hands down, finding LHCF!
* Deep conditioning weekly.
* Avoiding direct heat as much as possible.
* Moisturizing my hair.
* Protective Styling
* Hair2Heaven Stimulating Scalp Oil and Hair2Heaven End All Balm. I love this whole line but these two products really helped me along my journey. I can not be without either.
* Avoiding mineral oil and petrolatum on my scalp.
