## What is your hair care regimen?

**My staple products**

* Organic Root Stimulator hair mayo
* Queen Helen Hot oil
* Fantasia IC heat protectant serum
* Creme of Nature detangling conditioning shampoo
* Aveda Elixir (now discontinuedL)
* Joico reconstructor
* Via semi-permanent hair color

I usually experiment with my moisturizing conditioners.

**Some of my favorites are**

* Motions moisture plus conditioner
* Joico moisture recovery conditioner
* Silicon Mix
* Victoria's Secret So Sexy conditioner.
* Therma Silk volumizing conditioner.

**Some of my other products include**

* Pantene clarifying shampoo
* Coconut oil (I use this once a month as a hot oil treatment)
* Elasta QP lye relaxer.
* Elasta QP H-two leave-in
* John Frieda Brilliant Brunette Satin shine finishing CrÃ¨me.

**For the wash and go**

* John Frieda curly shampoo
* Garnier Fructis curl Construct mousse
* John Frieda dream curls spray

**What I do**

* I wash 2 times a week in the winter and 3 times a week in the summer
* Once a week I condition with Organic root stimulator hair mayo, and one of the moisturizing conditioner I mentioned above.
* Add hot oil to the mix. Leave it on for about an hour.
* I make sure to detangle my hair in the shower using a bit of shampoo and a wide tooth comb.
* My 'during the week' washes consist of shampooing in the shower and leaving a moisturizing conditioner on for about 5 minutes.
* After towel drying (letting my hair dry in a towel wrap for about half an hour) I add a dollop of Aveda elixir and a little IC heat protectant shine serum. I have to add that I use Frizz ease serum also. But just a tiny bit as it can be heavy.
* I either roller set with the grey and black rollers. Sit under a hooded dryer for 1.5 hrs and flat-iron my roots.
* Or blow dry and flat iron my hair on the lowest setting. When I flat-iron my hair with a higher setting my hair is too silky to wrap or do anything with.
* I don't use a daily moisturizer in my hair cause my hair is fine and easily gets weighed down. But when I'm wearing my hair curly I use John Frieda Brilliant Brunette satin shine finishing cream. My hair loves it. I noticed that if I put it in my hair when my hair is straight it doesn't weight it down but I still prefer not to use a moisturizer when wearing it straight. I have very oily hair so I don't really need it.
* I Perm every 8 to 10 weeks using Elasta QP lye relaxer in regular.
* I Clarify bi-weekly
* Use Joico reconstructor once a month
* Trim with every perm.

## Do you take any supplements? If so, what are they?

I take Centrum multi-vit. I recently started taking Iron and Vit B-12 because I'm anemic.

## Currently, how long is your hair and what is your hair type?

My hair is past my waist. Some say its tail bone length but I'm not sure I want to claim that just yet.

My hair type is 3c with some 4a on the right, front side of my head.

## What are the things that you feel have helped you the most in achieving and maintaining your hair length?

Weekly deep conditioning is a Prayer for me. I'm sure without them my hair won't be able to withstand so much heat.

I would say detangling in the shower has helped me a lot. I discovered this technique about 7 years ago and have not looked back since. It's the best thing that's ever happened for my hair. Also, getting my hair trimmed every 8 weeks seems to work for me. I never ever see split ends and I attribute that to regular trims and a simplified routine. I've stuck with the same routine for years and years and I don't jump on any bandwagons. I just stick to what works for me.
