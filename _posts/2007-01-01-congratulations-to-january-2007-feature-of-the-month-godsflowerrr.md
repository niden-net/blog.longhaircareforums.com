## What is your hair care regimen?

I have changed my hair care regimen so many times. Lately, I have been keeping it as simple as possible. I shampoo my hair weekly with keracare hydrating shampoo. Before shampooing my hair, I prepoo with any cheap conditioner that I have around the house. I place the conditioner on my dry hair and sit under the hood dryer for 10 to 15 minutes. After shampooing my hair, I deep condition weekly with Nexxus humectress and sit under the warm hood dryer for about 15 to 20 minutes then rinse. Finally, I use the infusium leave-in conditioner. For the past few weeks I have been roller setting my hair and it has done wonders for my hair in such a short period of time. I must say that I'm hooked on roller setting now. To maintain my hair style during the week, I just pin curl it. Sometimes I do wrap my hair at night or place a few zulu knots in my hair for soft waves the next day. Toward the end of the week I usually wear buns. I moisturize my hair daily with Profectiv root health. I try to give myself an Aphogee protein treatment every 6-8 weeks. I trim my hair as needed. Usually every 4-6 months. Once in a while I will flat iron my hair with my sedu iron and I always use a heat protector like ic polisher before flat ironing my hair.

## Do you take any supplements? If so, what are they?

Previously, I took prenatal vitamins daily along with MSM and horsetail. I have stopped taking all three of these and started taking 'juice plus' daily and my hair has been doing very well with this supplement. I also take flax seed oil daily.

## Currently, how long is your hair and what is your hair type?

My hair is about one inch from bra strap. I had a major set back this year. The ends of my hair thinned badly and I had to cut off 1 Â½ inches because of major breakage that I had obtained. This was due to relaxer stretching for too long and breakage from wearing weaves while not taking the best care of my hair under the weave. I have decided not to put extensions in my hair anymore. Nor will I stretch my relaxers. It just doesn't work for my hair.

My hair type is a 4a.

## What are the things that you feel have helped you the most in achieving and maintaining your hair length?

The main thing that is helping me to maintain length is staying away from direct heat, weekly deep conditioning and wearing protective styles. Lately, I have been only finger combing my hair during the week and it has been working out incredibly well for my hair. My goal is to have mid back length hair.

Hopefully it will happen eventually but until then I'm going to enjoy my hair every step of the way. (Smile)
