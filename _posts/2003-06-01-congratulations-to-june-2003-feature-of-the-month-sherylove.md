## What is your hair care regimen?

When it comes to my Crown and Glory, I use only natural, organic products and oils (excluding the Dudley's relaxer that is). Over time, this has definitely made a marked improvement in the condition of my hair.

My hair is constantly growing and has incredible length and shine. My moisture-thirsty tresses love the Island Naturals, Swimmers, and Jojoba/Aloe lines of Aubrey Organics for shampooing and conditioning.

Once a week, my hairstylist massages my scalp for 10 minutes, then washes and deep conditions my hair. After she rinses the conditioner from my hair, she applies a detangling leave in conditioner by Giovanni with a hint of aloe vera gel before she sets my hair on magnetic rollers. I then sit under a hooded dryer to dry my hair. She never uses direct heat on my hair.

Every six weeks, my hairstylist takes care to use a clarifying shampoo on my hair to get rid of any product build up followed by a moisturizing protein (Jojoba & Aloe conditioner) to keep my tresses strong and moisturized.

My hairstylist relaxes my hair with Dudley's regular strength relaxer every four months. I trim my own ends every six months. I oil my scalp and hair twice a week with a heavenly mixture of castor, jojoba and rosemary oils, paying special attention to my ends.

## Currently how long is your hair?

My hair is currently 29 inches long. My hair type is 3c/4a.

## Do you take any supplements, if so what are they?

Using superior hair care products and adhering to a haircare regimen that works for me has helped me to achieve and maintain healthy hair and a desireable length.

## What are the things that you feel have helped you the most in achieving and maintaining your hair length?

* Multivitamin flaxseed
* oil/evening primrose
* oil/borage oil (essential fatty acids)
* chlorophyll.
